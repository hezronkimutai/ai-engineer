Analysis of the LLM & AI Engineer Practical TestBased on the required skills and core responsibilities, the practical test is designed to measure your hands-on ability to build and deploy robust, LLM-powered applications. Expect the test to be a time-constrained coding challenge, likely in Python.1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation (High Probability)This is the most fundamental requirement for enterprise LLM use cases. The test will assess your ability to connect an LLM to external, proprietary data.Likely Scenario:You will be given a small set of unstructured documents (e.g., PDFs, Markdown files, or a mock database dump) and tasked with building a RAG pipeline that can accurately answer complex questions based only on that provided knowledge base.Skills Assessed:Vector Database Proficiency: Correctly initializing and populating a vector database (e.g., using a local instance of Qdrant or in-memory vector store).Data Processing: Using document loaders and chunking strategies (e.g., recursive character text splitter) to prepare the data for embedding.Query Optimization: Building a retrieval chain that includes prompt engineering (system prompts) to ensure the LLM only uses the context provided by the retriever.Framework Use: Seamlessly integrating these steps using LangChain or a similar framework.2. Autonomous Agent Design and Tool Use (Very High Probability)The job description explicitly focuses on "intelligent, autonomous systems" and requires a "strong understanding of AI Agent design, memory, tools and planning architectures." This will be a core assessment.Likely Scenario:You will be asked to build a single or multi-step agent that can perform a complex task by utilizing specific functions or "tools."Skills Assessed:Agent Orchestration: Defining the agent's behavior and setting up the control flow using frameworks like LangGraph or LangChain Agents.Tool Creation: Writing clean, callable Python functions (tools) that the agent must learn to use (e.g., a function to fetch a mock stock price, or to send a mock email).Reasoning and Planning: Ensuring the agent correctly reasons through the steps, selects the appropriate tool, and handles the output to generate the final answer.Memory Integration: Implementing conversation history or a scratchpad (memory) to help the agent maintain context across turns.3. LLMOps and Observability Setup (Moderate Probability)Since the required skills section mentions "Familiarity with LLMOps tools (LangFuse, LangWatch, etc.)," they will likely check if you understand how to monitor and evaluate your deployed solutions.Likely Scenario:After completing a RAG or Agent task, you might be asked to integrate a tracing or evaluation system.Skills Assessed:Tracing: Adding tracing to the workflow to monitor latency, token usage, and step-by-step reasoning (e.g., setting up LangFuse integration keys and wrapping the chain).Evaluation: Defining simple metrics or a process to measure the accuracy or relevance of the LLM's output against a set of ground truth answers.4. Direct LLM Integration & Deployment (Foundational Test)A quick test might focus on your raw ability to integrate LLMs into a backend service.Likely Scenario:Creating a simple API endpoint (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) that accepts a user prompt, calls an LLM (e.g., using the OpenAI Python library or an open-source model endpoint), and returns a structured JSON response (using Pydantic schemas).Skills Assessed:API Design: Demonstrating command of Python backend development.Model Invocation: Correctly handling API keys, model parameters, and rate limits.Structured Output: Proving you can force the LLM to return reliable, parseable data types.
